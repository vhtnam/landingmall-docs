Creating a new database
==============
First thing you want to do before installing LandingMall is to create a new database on your mysql server. If you already know how to do this/or have already created one just skip to the next step.

Your host will most likely be running phpMyAdmin as mysql manager, if that's the case here's a step by step guide (if not the proccess will be very similar on other managers).

Login to your control panel, find and click phpMyAdmin link. Click on the database tab in the top menu, enter any name you like and click create.
